  abstract = {Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)-modeling links dose-concentration relationships (PK) and concentration-effect relationships (PD), thereby facilitating the description and prediction of the time course of drug effects resulting from a certain dosing regimen. PK/PD-modeling approaches can basically be distinguished by four major attributes. The first characterizes the link between measured drug concentration and the response system, direct link versus indirect link. The second considers how the response system relates effect site concentration to the observed outcome, direct versus indirect response. The third regards what clinically or experimentally assessed information is used to establish the link between concentration and effect, hard link versus soft link. And the fourth considers the time dependency of pharmacodynamic model parameters, distinguishing between time-variant versus time-invariant. Application of PK/PD-modeling concepts has been identified as potentially beneficial in all phases of preclinical and clinical drug development. Although today predominantly limited to research, broader application of PK/PD-concepts in clinical therapy will provide a more rational basis for patient-specific dosage individualization and may thus guide applied pharmacotherapy to a higher level of performance.},

  abstract = {Modeling & simulation (M&S) methodologies are established quantitative tools, which have proven to be useful in supporting the research, development (R&D), regulatory approval, and marketing of novel therapeutics. Applications of M&S help design efficient studies and interpret their results in context of all available data and knowledge to enable effective decision-making during the R&D process. In this mini-review, we focus on two sets of modeling approaches: population-based models, which are well-established within the pharmaceutical industry today, and fall under the discipline of clinical pharmacometrics (PMX); and systems dynamics models, which encompass a range of models of (patho-)physiology amenable to pharmacological intervention, of signaling pathways in biology, and of substance distribution in the body (today known as physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models) - which today may be collectively referred to as quantitative systems pharmacology models (QSP). We next describe the convergence - or rather selected integration - of PMX and QSP approaches into 'middle-out' drug-disease models, which retain selected mechanistic aspects, while remaining parsimonious, fit-for-purpose, and able to address variability and the testing of covariates. We further propose development opportunities for drug-disease systems models, to increase their utility and applicability throughout the preclinical and clinical spectrum of pharmaceutical R&D.},
